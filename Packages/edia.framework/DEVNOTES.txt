DEV NOTES
-----------------------

* Add package URP to this project. 
Issues with the assets? 
Test conversion separate first.

* When the SystemManger is not used, the XRrig tries to find the `MainCamera`, `RightController`, `LeftController` by tag. 
But: Does the tag definitions get synced with GIT ? 
Is there maybe a more 'safe' way of doing this? 

* UXF tries to check all kind of things before building the project. Some are in the way as we don't care about DynamoDB at this point for instance. 
So I edited the scripts a bit in order to let it build.

* [ eDIA ] XR
Our [eDIA]XR is not just a rig, it is the base of the whole app. It holds the singleton for systemmanager, the mainmenu, input handlers, xr input system mapping, sceneloading and more.
In order to use it, just put the [eDIA]INIT prefab in a scene, NOT the [eDIA]XR prefab itself!!.

[ UXF adjustments ]
* Commented out all content of the OnProcessScene method in /UXF/Scripts/Etc/Editor/UXFBuildPreprocessor.cs
* Deleted /UXF/Scripts/DataHandling/WebAWSDynamoDB.cs as the ILCPP get's confused on that one for some reason
