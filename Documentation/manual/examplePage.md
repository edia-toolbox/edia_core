Old friends pass away, new friends appear. It is just like the days. 
An old day passes, a new day arrives. 
The important thing is to make it meaningful: a meaningful friend – or a meaningful day. ― Dalai Lama

## Some other title

Latentia ante, eundem meritorum *italic*! Elige in timuit templa ferrea, qui arma
ligati stagnum turbant. Fraternaque aeternus, dedisse, naufragus corripiens
ranas Amathunta et quod laetior culpa nec semper scorpius fuit vicem corpora
ardere. Fallit in artus primordia, fratres **in bold**, ipsi manu **and even more bold**.
