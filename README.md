# EDIA – A Unity XR Toolbox for Research

 `EDIA` provides you with a set of modules (Unity packages) to facilitate the design and conduction of experimental research in XR using Unity.  

## `EDIA` Features:
🧱 Structure your experiment on multiple levels.    
🗂️ Manage it using Config Files.  
👁️ Unified eye tracking integration.  
🛜 Remotely control mobile XR experiments.     
✏️ Automatically log relevant data.  
🟰 Synchronize with external data.  

# `EDIA` is for you if ...
- you want to build experiments which use different tasks in the same experimental session.
- you need high temporal precision to, for example, synchronize your experiment with EEG.
- you want an easy integration of eye tracking in your experiment.
- you want to use configuration files (JSON) to manage your experiment.

# Getting started
For newcomers to EDIA, we recommend to follow our "[Getting started](https://mind-body-emotion.notion.site/EDIA-Tutorial-1cb03dd4773f801285edf12e8b6018bd)" guide. This also has more detailed instructions on how to install `EDIA` as a package and how to set up your Unity Editor. 

# Installation

- Hit `ADD`

Unity now starts to download and install the `com.edia.core` package. 

### For development
